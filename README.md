# SDL Text Engine

Inspired by my time in the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) community.

This is a RPG-Styled text engine where it prints a string character by character.

This is just a header and source file, not a shared library, so you can use it and modify it in your project however you like. I made this for my team's TSA Video Game Design Project which is [here](https://github.com/TSAVideoGame/game).

I may or may not continue working on this...
